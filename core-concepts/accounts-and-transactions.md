# Accounts & Transactions

Accounts and transactions on Polygon function exactly the same as they do on mainnet Ethereum, except with lower gas fees and faster finality while maintaining the same security standards.

In order to start developing, you will need an account with some testnet tokens. Please read [**this guide**](https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask) to get Metamask connected to the Polygon & Mumbai RPCs. The documentation also includes details on creating multiple accounts and how to transfer funds between each.
