# Why Polygon?

Top 10 reasons to build on Polygon:

* Polygon is the best platform to build scalable decentralized applications. It's the way Ethereum solves the blockchain trilemma; scalable, decentralized, and secure.
* Low gas transactions are made possible through polygon's proof of stake based plasma chain, secured by a network of validators. No more high gas fees, just sea OpenSea for an example of minting NFTs for free using Polygon.
* High throughput. Polygon now has the industries leading suite of ZK rollup solutions in the pipeline, there's no better way to ensure that fast transactions are secured by the Ethereum blockchain
* An amazing community. Check out the polygon discord today with any questions you have, the team is always available to help any developer on their building journey.
* Funding: We've dedicated over 1M USD to grants for promising dapp projects and ideas. Apply now to our fund to get started scaling your dapp to serve the next billion internet users.
* Partnerships: With EY, Coinbase, the NFL, and DraftKings already secured, no other blockchain has secured so many major industry partnerships in such a short period of time. This makes integrating your dapp into a larger network very simple.
* Solidity-native programming: No need to learn a new smart contract language like Rust, with Polygon you can build your dapp's using solidity native tooling like Truffle, Ganache, and HardHat, the only difference is that it's deployed to polygon instead of Ethereum
* World Class documentation: We've curated a huge list of documentation both from our team and the community at large, visit the polygon docs today to learn more.
* Ethereum's Endorsement: Vitalik Buterin spoke at our ZK summit and has repeatedly congratulated polygon on it's mission, Polygon is Ethereum 2.0, they are intimately interconnected.
* A huge developer ecosystem: There are 1000s of production ready dapps already available on the polygon network, see [www.awesome-polygon.com](http://www.awesome-polygon.com) for more examples.
